In Next.js **(dir_name)** is called a **Route Group**.

It looks like:

```
app/(dashboard)/dashboard/...
```

And here is the **simple explanation**:

---

# ✅ **Why do we use `(dir_name)` in Next.js?**

### **Because it groups routes *without affecting the URL*.**

Example:

```
app/(dashboard)/dashboard/user/page.jsx
```

The URL becomes:

```
/dashboard/user
```

NOT:

```
/(dashboard)/dashboard/user   ❌
```

---

# 🧠 **Why Route Groups are useful?**

## 1️⃣ **Separate layouts**

You can give a whole section (like a dashboard) its own layout:

```
app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx   ← Dashboard layout
app/(dashboard)/dashboard/... pages
```

But still keep all URLs clean:

```
/dashboard/admin
/dashboard/user
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Avoid global layouts**

You can place certain pages *outside* the global layout.

Example:

```
app/layout.tsx               ← global layout (navbar)
app/(auth)/login/page.jsx    ← NO global layout
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Organize folders without changing URL structure**

You can group code by functionality:

```
app/(marketing)/about
app/(marketing)/contact

app/(dashboard)/dashboard/user
app/(dashboard)/dashboard/admin
```

But URLs stay nice:

```
/about
/contact
/dashboard/user
/dashboard/admin
```

---

# ✅ ASCII Example (Simple)

```
app/
  layout.tsx                ← global
  page.tsx

  (dashboard)/              ← group
    layout.tsx              ← dashboard layout
    dashboard/
      user/page.jsx
      admin/page.jsx
```

URL output:

```
/dashboard/user
/dashboard/admin
```

---

# ⭐ TL;DR — **Why use `(dir_name)`?**

```
✔ Group routes
✔ Apply separate layouts
✔ Keep clean URLs
✔ Organize project without affecting routing
```
