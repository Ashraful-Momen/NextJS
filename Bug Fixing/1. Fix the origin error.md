Ah! That **warning** is not a fatal error—your Next.js app is **running fine**, but the browser is telling you about a **cross-origin request** during development. Let me explain clearly and how to fix it.

---

### **What’s happening**

```
⚠ Cross origin request detected from 192.168.1.105 to /_next/* resource
```

* You are **accessing your dev server from a different IP** (like your phone or another PC on the network: `192.168.1.105`).
* Next.js dev server sees this as a **cross-origin request** to `_next/*` (JS, CSS, fonts, etc.).
* In **future Next.js versions**, this will fail unless you explicitly allow it.

---

### **How to fix**

Add `allowedDevOrigins` in your `next.config.js`:

```js
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false, // optional, hides build logs
  },
  allowedDevOrigins: [
    'http://192.168.1.105:3000', // your dev client
    'http://localhost:3000'      // local dev
  ],
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

* Replace `192.168.1.105:3000` with the IP and port you are using to access the app.
* Then **restart the dev server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### ✅ Notes

1. **This is only for development**. In production, your domain serves the assets normally, so no cross-origin issues.
2. If you just access via `localhost:3000`, the warning disappears without any config.
3. The `GET / 200 in ...` messages are normal request logs.

---

So your app works; this is **just a dev warning** about future stricter cross-origin rules.
